# foodmart-analysis
This is my analysis of a public food mart dataset

In the raw_data folder, you should find 4 inter-related datasets: a dataset of transactions, a dataset of products, a dataset of product_classes, and a dataset with information about promotions. 
The original source is a freely available Foodmart dataset.

Question 1

Management is trying to better understand what is happening at these food marts. To that end, please create some visualizations to help us better understand the following dimensions of the Foodmart data: - Category of products sold - Brand of products sold

Question 2

The executive team at Foodmart is starting to brainstorm approaches for growing sales and profitability next year. And by next year, we mean 1998. :) They’ve asked the analytics team to highlight 2-3 insights from the previous year’s data to help inform the strategy for next year.

Please provide an executive summary of your findings, the implications for Foodmart, and the supporting analysis.
